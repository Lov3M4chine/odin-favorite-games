# odin-favorite-games
A webpage consisting of my favorite video games. 

This project is a collections of several of my favorite games. It will list my favorite games in numerical order, and provide links to the pages for those games that describes why I like them, with pros and cons of each for the reader to determine if it might be a game they would like. 

This projection demonstrates HTML skills, such as managing a series of webpages, linking pages, as well as formatting text with bullets, headers, italics, bold etc. It also demonstrates the ability to add images to a webpage via HTML.
